# Enhancing Volume of Distribution Predictions with Subgroup-Based Machine Learning Techniques

![Project Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee508f3-1aa2-45d9-bbcb-3229aeacea0d)


> This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning (ML) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline designed to predict molecular properties based on SMILES representations. A standout feature of this pipeline is the integration of subgroup analysis, which enhances model performance by incorporating probabilistic subgroup information derived from the dataset. The pipeline encompasses data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization. It leverages various ML models and advanced GNN architectures to achieve robust and accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the following paper:

> **Lombardo, F., Berellini, G., & Obach, R. S. (2018).** Trend Analysis of a Database of Intravenous Pharmacokinetics Parameters in Humans for 1352 Drug Compounds. *Drug Metab. Dispos.*, **46**, 1466-1477.

This dataset comprises intravenous pharmacokinetic parameters in humans for **1,352 drug compounds**, including features like SMILES representations and various pharmacokinetic measurements. A significant aspect of this dataset is the inclusion of subgroup classifications derived from label propagation techniques, which are instrumental in enhancing model performance.
